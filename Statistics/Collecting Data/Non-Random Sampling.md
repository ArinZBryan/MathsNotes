The population is divided into groups according to a characteristic. A quota of items/people in each group is set to try and reflect the group's proportion in the whole population.
*<u>The interviewer must select the actual sampling units</u>*

### Advantages

- Allows for easy comparison between different groups in population.

### Disadvantages
- Non-random sampling can introduce bias.
- Population must be divided into groups, which can be costly or inaccurate.
- Increasing scope of study increases the number of groups, which adds time / expense.
- Non-responses are not recorded.
