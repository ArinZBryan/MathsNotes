# Populations and Samples

## Populations vs. Samples
A population is: the <u>whole</u> set of items that are of interest

A sample is the name given to some subset of the population intended to represent the population. Once you have this group, it is known as a '*sampling frame*'.
> This can cause confusion, as the difference between a sample and a sampling frame may not be obvious.
> They are the same thing, the difference is just a quirk of language.
> You would take a *sample* of the population resulting in having a *sampling frame*. The *sampling frame* is the group of people who are to be surveyed.

Each individual thing in the population that can be samples is known as a sampling unit.

Often sampling units of a population are individually 
named or numbered to **form a list** called the **sampling frame**. It can be said that a sampling frame is a *sub-population* of the overall population that we are interested in.

We can collect data either from a sample, or from the entire population. Data collected from the entire population is known as a **census**

| | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Census | Should give a completely accurate answer | <ul> <li>Time consuming and expensive.</li><li>Can not be used when testing involves destruction</li><li>Large volume of data to process</li></ul> |
| Sample | <ul><li>Cheaper</li><li>Quicker</li><li>Less data to process</li></ul> | <ul><li>Data may not be accurate</li><li>Data may not be large enough to represent small sub-groups</li></ul> |
