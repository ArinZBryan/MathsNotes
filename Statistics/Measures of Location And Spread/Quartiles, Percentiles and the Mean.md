# Quartiles, Percentiles and the Mean
## Mean
To find a mean of ungrouped data, the position to take is found by using the equation: $\frac{1}{2}n$. If the value given is whole, use the midpoint between that position and the next, otherwise, round up to the next whole number, and use the value at that index.

## Quartiles
To find a quartile, use the same rules used to find the mean, except instead of finding the halfway point, find the 25% point and the 75% point.

This means that for grouped data, use linear interpolation to find the correct point.
For ungrouped data, find $\frac{1}{4}n$ or $\frac{3}{4}n$ and then:
- If not whole: Round Up
- Otherwise use the value of the halfway point between this item and the next.

## Percentiles
This will never be asked for in regards to ungrouped data, so use the position calculated by the equation:
$n * \frac{N}{100}$ where $N$ is the percentile.
From here, use linear interpolation to find the actual value.

## Notation
There is some specific notation for quartiles and percentiles:  
$Q_1$ = Lower Quartile  
$Q_3$ = Upper Quartile  
$Q_2$ = Median  
$P_n$ = $n^{th}$ percentile
