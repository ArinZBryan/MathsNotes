# Cumulative Frequency

## Plotting Cumulative Frequency Graphs
- Cumulative frequency graphs are of cumulative frequency on the y axis, and the variable measured on the x axis
- The top of the ranges should be used when plotting the values. Eg, for the range $9 \le x < 12$ where the cumulative frequency is 10, plot a point at (12, 10)
