# Logarithms

## The definition of a log:  

$p^q = r \leftrightarrow \log_p{r} = q$

some basic examples:  
$\log_3{9} = 2$  
$\log_5{1/5} = -1$  
$\log_x{(\sqrt[3]{x})} = 1/3$  
$log_4(1/8) = -3/2$

### Natural Logarithms
- Generally, if the logarithm is base $e$, it is called the natural log ($\ln$)

### Older Notation
In some older questions, the $\log_{10}(x)$ may be expressed as lug(x)

## The Log Laws

- $\log_p(xy) = \log_p(x) + \log_p(y)$

- $\log_p(\frac{x}{y}) = \log_p(x) - \log_p(y)$

- $\log_p(x^y) = y\log_p(x)$

- $\log_p(x) =\frac{\log_q(x)}{\log_q(p)}$  
    (This one is knonw as the base change rule. It rarely comes up in A-level)
- $\log_p(p) = 1$
- $\log_p(1) = 0$
