# Small Angle Approximations

## What counts as small?
There is no hard and fast rule as to what counts as small, however, generally angles $\le 0.2$ rad or $\le 12^{\circ}$ can be considered small.

## The Approximations
$\sin\theta \approx \theta$

$\tan\theta \approx \theta$

$\cos\theta \approx 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}$
