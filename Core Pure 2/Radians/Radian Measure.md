# Radian Measure

## Converting between degrees and radians

$2\pi$ rad $=360^{\circ}$  

$\pi$ rad $=180^{\circ}$

$1$ rad $=\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}$

## Arc Length
$l = r\theta$  
Where $r$ is the radius, and $\theta$ the angle in radians contained by the sector

## Area of a sector
$A_{rea} = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$  
Where $r$ is the radius, and $\theta$ the angle in radians contained by the sector
